# Sustainability Plan

The Food Mappers team made several technology choices which will add to the sustainability of this project.  First, the application is built using the [Django Project][1] as a backend.  Django is a popular web framework with an [active developer community][2] that uses the Python language. Significant documentation for Django is available online and a new developer, familiar with MVC should be able to contribute and understand the project fairly easily.  The application is structured in a modular fashion allowing for extensibility and longevity.  

The frontend is also implemented using open and popular tools with active developer communities.  User interface components are built using the popular [Twitter Bootstrap][3].  [LeafletJS][4] is the open mapping library that is used for the project and is easy to learn and use.

Our code base is saved in GitHub so that further development can utilize the source code. Documented and commented code commits are available through the GitHub repository. Some of the important blocks we ran into were documented too. Github is utilized not only as a code repository, but also as a wiki, issue tracker, and documentation repository.  

Project customer, Carl DiSalvo, will continue gathering support for the development of the software following the Fall 2013 C4G class.
